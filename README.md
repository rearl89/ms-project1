First milestone project (Web Browser Game)
Arkanoid Clone

Inspiration
--------------------
The reason I picked this game to be my milestone project is because it was one of my favorite games I played on my APPLE IIGS computer growing up. It is essentially a Breakout brick type game, but has power-ups (such as having a the ability to shoot the bricks or the ball being able to break through every brick in its path) and some bricks have to be hit more than once to break them. The goal is to first make a basic Breakout game and if I have time I will add these other features.

Objective
--------------------
How you play is there is a ball that will fall down to your paddle and you have to make sure to block the ball from hitting the ground, otherwise you lose. When you successfully block the ball, it will bounce off your paddle and bounce off walls and bricks. When bricks are hit, they break. The goal is to break all the bricks on screen.

Controls
--------------------
Left Arrow: Move Left
Right Arrow: Move right
